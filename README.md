# TennisGame_v2
more complexity to refactor.  including a UI (console) to make testable 

This codebase, is a starting point for a refactoring-kata.  When you get tired from the simple ones, try and make this code, and especially the UI, so that the 'console-style' doesn't leak through the whole UI.  

extra 'features' to add : 
* make the system detect that a player has won, and ask for a new game;
* make the system aware of more tennis context and
    * make it behave as a set of 6 games
    * make it aware of winning a set only if you win by 2 setpoints
    * ... well you get the point
